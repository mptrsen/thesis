	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btq516},
	abstract = {{MOTIVATION:} Selenoproteins are a group of proteins that contain selenocysteine (Sec), a rare amino acid inserted co-translationally into the protein chain. The Sec codon is {UGA}, which is normally a stop codon. In selenoproteins {UGA} is recoded to Sec in presence of specific features on selenoprotein gene transcripts. Due to the dual role of the {UGA} codon, selenoprotein prediction and annotation are difficult tasks, and even known selenoproteins are often misannotated in genome databases. {RESULTS:} We present an homology-based in silico method to scan genomes for members of the known eukaryotic selenoprotein families: selenoprofiles. The core of the method is a set of manually curated highly reliable multiple sequence alignments of selenoprotein families, which are used as queries to scan genomic sequences. Results of the scan are processed through a number of steps, to produce highly accurate predictions of selenoprotein genes with little or no human intervention. Selenoprofiles is a valuable tool for bioinformatic characterization of eukaryotic selenoproteomes, and can complement genome annotation pipelines. Availability and Implementation: Selenoprofiles is a python-built pipeline that internally runs psitblastn, exonerate, genewise, {SECISearch}, and a number of custom made scripts and programs. The program is available at http://big.crg.cat/services/selenoprofiles. The predictions presented in this paper are available through {DAS} at {http://genome.crg.cat:9000/das/Selenoprofiles\_ensembl.} {CONTACT:} marco.mariotti@crg.es {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION:} Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Orthology detection is critically important for accurate functional annotation, and has been widely used to facilitate studies on comparative and evolutionary genomics. Although various methods are now available, there has been no comprehensive analysis of performance, due to the lack of a genomic-scale 'gold standard' orthology dataset. Even in the absence of such datasets, the comparison of results from alternative methodologies contains useful information, as agreement enhances confidence and disagreement indicates possible errors. Latent Class Analysis ({LCA)} is a statistical technique that can exploit this information to reasonably infer sensitivities and specificities, and is applied here to evaluate the performance of various orthology detection methods on a eukaryotic dataset. Overall, we observe a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity in orthology detection, with {BLAST-based} methods characterized by high sensitivity, and tree-based methods by high specificity. Two algorithms exhibit the best overall balance, with both sensitivity and specificity{\textgreater}80\%: {INPARANOID} identifies orthologs across two species while {OrthoMCL} clusters orthologs from multiple species. Among methods that permit clustering of ortholog groups spanning multiple genomes, the (automated) {OrthoMCL} algorithm exhibits better within-group consistency with respect to protein function and domain architecture than the (manually curated) {KOG} database, and the homolog clustering algorithm {TribeMCL} as well. By way of using {LCA}, we are also able to comprehensively assess similarities and statistical dependence between various strategies, and evaluate the effects of parameter settings on performance. In summary, we present a comprehensive evaluation of orthology detection on a divergent set of eukaryotic genomes, thus providing insights and guides for method selection, tuning and development for different applications. Many biological questions have been addressed by multiple tests yielding binary (yes/no) outcomes but no clear definition of truth, making {LCA} an attractive approach for computational biology.},

The trained {HMM} can then be used for discrimination or multiple alignment. The basic mathematical description of an {HMM} and its expectation-maximization training procedure is relatively straightforward. In this paper, we review the mathematical extensions and heuristics that move the method from the theoretical to the practical. We then experimentally analyze the effectiveness of model regularization, dynamic model modification and optimization strategies. Finally it is demonstrated on the {SH2} domain how a domain can be found from unaligned sequences using a special model type.

	abstract = {Almost a decade ago, a new phylogeny of bilaterian animals was inferred from small-subunit ribosomal {RNA} ({rRNA)} that claimed the monophyly of two major groups of protostome animals: Ecdysozoa (e.g., arthropods, nematodes, onychophorans, and tardigrades) and Lophotrochozoa (e.g., annelids, molluscs, platyhelminths, brachiopods, and rotifers). However, it received little additional support. In fact, several multigene analyses strongly argued against this new phylogeny. These latter studies were based on a large amount of sequence data and therefore showed an apparently strong statistical support. Yet, they covered only a few taxa (those for which complete genomes were available), making systematic artifacts of tree reconstruction more probable. Here we expand this sparse taxonomic sampling and analyze a large data set (146 genes, 35,371 positions) from a diverse sample of animals (35 species). Our study demonstrates that the incongruences observed between {rRNA} and multigene analyses were indeed due to long-branch attraction artifacts, illustrating the enormous impact of systematic biases on phylogenomic studies. A refined analysis of our data set excluding the most biased genes provides strong support in favor of the new animal phylogeny and in addition suggests that urochordates are more closely related to vertebrates than are cephalochordates. These findings have important implications for the interpretation of morphological and genomic data.},

	abstract = {The accuracy of multiple sequence alignment program {MAFFT} has been improved. The new version (5.3) of {MAFFT} offers new iterative refinement options, H-{INS-i}, F-{INS-i} and G-{INS-i}, in which pairwise alignment information are incorporated into objective function. These new options of {MAFFT} showed higher accuracy than currently available methods including {TCoffee} version 2 and {CLUSTAL} W in benchmark tests consisting of alignments of {\textgreater}50 sequences. Like the previously available options, the new options of {MAFFT} can handle hundreds of sequences on a standard desktop computer. We also examined the effect of the number of homologues included in an alignment. For a multiple alignment consisting of approximately 8 sequences with low similarity, the accuracy was improved (2-10 percentage points) when the sequences were aligned together with dozens of their close homologues (E-value {\textless} 10(-5)-10(-20)) collected from a database. Such improvement was generally observed for most methods, but remarkably large for the new options of {MAFFT} proposed here. Thus, we made a Ruby script, {mafftE.rb}, which aligns the input sequences together with their close homologues collected from {SwissProt} using {NCBI-BLAST.}},

Here we report the genome sequence of the model organism Aspergillus nidulans, and a comparative study with Aspergillus fumigatus, a serious human pathogen, and Aspergillus oryzae, used in the production of sake, miso and soy sauce. Our analysis of genome structure provided a quantitative evaluation of forces driving long-term eukaryotic genome evolution. It also led to an experimentally validated model of mating-type locus evolution, suggesting the potential for sexual reproduction in A. fumigatus and A. oryzae. Our analysis of sequence conservation revealed over 5,000 non-coding regions actively conserved across all three species. Within these regions, we identified potential functional elements including a previously uncharacterized {TPP} riboswitch and motifs suggesting regulation in filamentous fungi by Puf family genes. We further obtained comparative and experimental evidence indicating widespread translational regulation by upstream open reading frames. These results enhance our understanding of these widely studied fungi as well as provide new insight into eukaryotic genome evolution and gene regulation.},

The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward {DNA} and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long {DNA} sequences.

	doi = {10.1006/jmbi.2000.5197},
	abstract = {Orthologs are genes in different species that originate from a single gene in the last common ancestor of these species. Such genes have often retained identical biological roles in the present-day organisms. It is hence important to identify orthologs for transferring functional information between genes in different organisms with a high degree of reliability. For example, orthologs of human proteins are often functionally characterized in model organisms. Unfortunately, orthology analysis between human and e.g. invertebrates is often complex because of large numbers of paralogs within protein families. Paralogs that predate the species split, which we call out-paralogs, can easily be confused with true orthologs. Paralogs that arose after the species split, which we call in-paralogs, however, are bona fide orthologs by definition. Orthologs and in-paralogs are typically detected with phylogenetic methods, but these are slow and difficult to automate. Automatic clustering methods based on two-way best genome-wide matches on the other hand, have so far not separated in-paralogs from out-paralogs effectively. We present a fully automatic method for finding orthologs and in-paralogs from two species. Ortholog clusters are seeded with a two-way best pairwise match, after which an algorithm for adding in-paralogs is applied. The method bypasses multiple alignments and phylogenetic trees, which can be slow and error-prone steps in classical ortholog detection. Still, it robustly detects complex orthologous relationships and assigns confidence values for both orthologs and in-paralogs. The program, called {INPARANOID}, was tested on all completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes. To assess the quality of {INPARANOID} results, ortholog clusters were generated from a dataset of worm and mammalian transmembrane proteins, and were compared to clusters derived by manual tree-based ortholog detection methods. This study led to the identification with a high degree of confidence of over a dozen novel worm-mammalian ortholog assignments that were previously undetected because of shortcomings of phylogenetic {methods.A} {WWW} server that allows searching for orthologs between human and several fully sequenced genomes is installed at http://www.cgb.ki.se/inparanoid/. This is the first comprehensive resource with orthologs of all fully sequenced eukaryotic genomes. Programs and tables of orthology assignments are available from the same location.},

We submitted predictions for five target sequences, of which four were later found to be suitable for threading. Our approach correctly predicted the fold for three of them. For a fourth sequence the fold could have been correctly predicted if a better model for its structure was available.

	issn = {1471-2105},
	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-12-326},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

As orthologous proteins are expected to retain function more often than other homologs, they are often used for functional annotation transfer between species. However, ortholog identification methods do not take into account changes in domain architecture, which are likely to modify a protein's function. By domain architecture we refer to the sequential arrangement of domains along a protein {sequence.To} assess the level of domain architecture conservation among orthologs, we carried out a large-scale study of such events between human and 40 other species spanning the entire evolutionary range. We designed a score to measure domain architecture similarity and used it to analyze differences in domain architecture conservation between orthologs and paralogs relative to the conservation of primary sequence. We also statistically characterized the extents of different types of domain swapping events across pairs of orthologs and paralogs.


{RESULTS}

The analysis shows that orthologs exhibit greater domain architecture conservation than paralogous homologs, even when differences in average sequence divergence are compensated for, for homologs that have diverged beyond a certain threshold. We interpret this as an indication of a stronger selective pressure on orthologs than paralogs to retain the domain architecture required for the proteins to perform a specific function. In general, orthologs as well as the closest paralogous homologs have very similar domain architectures, even at large evolutionary {separation.The} most common domain architecture changes observed in both ortholog and paralog pairs involved insertion/deletion of new domains, while domain shuffling and segment duplication/deletion were very infrequent.


{CONCLUSIONS}

On the whole, our results support the hypothesis that function conservation between orthologs demands higher domain architecture conservation than other types of homologs, relative to primary sequence conservation. This supports the notion that orthologs are functionally more similar than other types of homologs at the same evolutionary distance.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

In the past years the Smith-Waterman sequence comparison algorithm has gained popularity due to improved implementations and rapidly increasing computing power. However, the quality and sensitivity of a database search is not only determined by the algorithm but also by the statistical significance testing for an alignment. The e-value is the most commonly used statistical validation method for sequence database searching. The {CluSTr} database and the Protein World database have been created using an alternative statistical significance test: a Z-score based on Monte-Carlo statistics. Several papers have described the superiority of the Z-score as compared to the e-value, using simulated data. We were interested if this could be validated when applied to existing, evolutionary related protein sequences.


{RESULTS}

All experiments are performed on the {ASTRAL} {SCOP} database. The Smith-Waterman sequence comparison algorithm with both e-value and Z-score statistics is evaluated, using {ROC}, {CVE} and {AP} measures. The {BLAST} and {FASTA} algorithms are used as reference. We find that two out of three Smith-Waterman implementations with e-value are better at predicting structural similarities between proteins than the Smith-Waterman implementation with Z-score. {SSEARCH} especially has very high scores.


{CONCLUSION}

The compute intensive Z-score does not have a clear advantage over the e-value. The Smith-Waterman implementations give generally better results than their heuristic counterparts. We recommend using the {SSEARCH} algorithm combined with e-values for pairwise sequence comparisons.},

	abstract = {{DNA} translation frames can be disrupted for several reasons, including: (i) errors in sequence determination; (ii) {RNA} processing, such as intron removal and guide {RNA} editing; (iii) less commonly, polymerase frameshifting during transcription or ribosomal frameshifting during translation. Frameshifts frequently confound computational activities involving homologous sequences, such as database searches and inferences on structure, function or phylogeny made from multiple alignments. A dynamic alignment algorithm is reported here which compares a protein profile (a residue scoring matrix for one or more aligned sequences) against the three translation frames of a {DNA} strand, allowing frameshifting. The algorithm has been incorporated into a new package, {WiseTools}, for comparison of biological sequences. A protein profile can be compared against either a {DNA} sequence or a protein sequence. The program {PairWise} may be used interactively for alignment of any two sequence inputs. {SearchWise} can perform combinations of searches through {DNA} or protein databases by a protein profile or {DNA} sequence. Routine application of the programs has revealed a set of database entries with frameshifts caused by errors in sequence determination.},

The {InParanoid} algorithm itself has been revised and is now both more specific and sensitive. Based on results from our recent benchmarking of low-complexity filters in homology assignment, a two-pass {BLAST} approach was developed that makes use of high-precision compositional score matrix adjustment, but avoids the alignment truncation that sometimes follows. We have also updated the {InParanoid} web site ({http://InParanoid.sbc.su.se).} Several features have been added, the response times have been improved and the site now sports a new, clearer look. As the number of ortholog databases has grown, it has become difficult to compare among these resources due to a lack of standardized source data and incompatible representations of ortholog relationships. To facilitate data exchange and comparisons among ortholog databases, we have developed and are making available two {XML} schemas: {SeqXML} for the input sequences and {OrthoXML} for the output ortholog clusters.},

	abstract = {Hidden Markov Models ({HMMs)} are applied to the problems of statistical modeling, database searching and multiple sequence alignment of protein families and protein domains. These methods are demonstrated on the globin family, the protein kinase catalytic domain, and the {EF-hand} calcium binding motif. In each case the parameters of an {HMM} are estimated from a training set of unaligned sequences. After the {HMM} is built, it is used to obtain a multiple alignment of all the training sequences. It is also used to search the {SWISS-PROT} 22 database for other sequences that are members of the given protein family, or contain the given domain. The {HMM} produces multiple alignments of good quality that agree closely with the alignments produced by programs that incorporate three-dimensional structural information. When employed in discrimination tests (by examining how closely the sequences in a database fit the globin, kinase and {EF-hand} {HMMs)}, the {HMM} is able to distinguish members of these families from non-members with a high degree of accuracy. Both the {HMM} and {PROFILESEARCH} (a technique used to search for relationships between a protein sequence and multiply aligned sequences) perform better in these tests than {PROSITE} (a dictionary of sites and patterns in proteins). The {HMM} appears to have a slight advantage over {PROFILESEARCH} in terms of lower rates of false negatives and false positives, even though the {HMM} is trained using only unaligned sequences, whereas {PROFILESEARCH} requires aligned training sequences. Our results suggest the presence of an {EF-hand} calcium binding motif in a highly conserved and evolutionary preserved putative intracellular region of 155 residues in the alpha-1 subunit of L-type calcium channels which play an important role in excitation-contraction coupling. This region has been suggested to contain the functional domains that are typical or essential for all L-type calcium channels regardless of whether they couple to ryanodine receptors, conduct ions or both.},

We have obtained 1873 5' {cDNA} sequences (expressed sequence tags, {ESTs)} from the velvet worm Epiperipatus sp., which were assembled into 833 contigs. {BLAST} similarity searches revealed that 51.9\% of the contigs had matches in the protein databases with expectation values lower than 10(-4). Most {ESTs} had the best hit with proteins from either Chordata or Arthropoda (approximately 40\% respectively). The {ESTs} included sequences of 27 ribosomal proteins. The orthologous sequences from 28 other species of a broad range of phyla were obtained from the databases, including other {EST} projects. A concatenated amino acid alignment comprising 5021 positions was constructed, which covers 4259 positions when problematic regions were removed. Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods place Epiperipatus within the monophyletic Ecdysozoa (Onychophora, Arthropoda, Tardigrada and Nematoda), but its exact relation to the Euarthropoda remained unresolved. The {"Articulata"} concept was not supported. Tardigrada and Nematoda formed a well-supported monophylum, suggesting that Tardigrada are actually Cycloneuralia. In agreement with previous studies, we have demonstrated that random sequencing of {cDNAs} results in sequence information suitable for phylogenomic approaches to resolve metazoan relationships.},

	abstract = {The availability of multiple, essentially complete genome sequences of prokaryotes and eukaryotes spurred both the demand and the opportunity for the construction of an evolutionary classification of genes from these genomes. Such a classification system based on orthologous relationships between genes appears to be a natural framework for comparative genomics and should facilitate both functional annotation of genomes and large-scale evolutionary {studies.We} describe here a major update of the previously developed system for delineation of Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins ({COGs)} from the sequenced genomes of prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes and the construction of clusters of predicted orthologs for 7 eukaryotic genomes, which we named {KOGs} after eukaryotic orthologous groups. The {COG} collection currently consists of 138,458 proteins, which form 4873 {COGs} and comprise 75\% of the 185,505 (predicted) proteins encoded in 66 genomes of unicellular organisms. The eukaryotic orthologous groups ({KOGs)} include proteins from 7 eukaryotic genomes: three animals (the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens), one plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, two fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe), and the intracellular microsporidian parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi. The current {KOG} set consists of 4852 clusters of orthologs, which include 59,838 proteins, or approximately 54\% of the analyzed eukaryotic 110,655 gene products. Compared to the coverage of the prokaryotic genomes with {COGs}, a considerably smaller fraction of eukaryotic genes could be included into the {KOGs;} addition of new eukaryotic genomes is expected to result in substantial increase in the coverage of eukaryotic genomes with {KOGs.} Examination of the phyletic patterns of {KOGs} reveals a conserved core represented in all analyzed species and consisting of approximately 20\% of the {KOG} set. This conserved portion of the {KOG} set is much greater than the ubiquitous portion of the {COG} set (approximately 1\% of the {COGs).} In part, this difference is probably due to the small number of included eukaryotic genomes, but it could also reflect the relative compactness of eukaryotes as a clade and the greater evolutionary stability of eukaryotic {genomes.The} updated collection of orthologous protein sets for prokaryotes and eukaryotes is expected to be a useful platform for functional annotation of newly sequenced genomes, including those of complex eukaryotes, and genome-wide evolutionary studies.},

	abstract = {Long-held ideas regarding the evolutionary relationships among animals have recently been upended by sometimes controversial hypotheses based largely on insights from molecular data. These new hypotheses include a clade of moulting animals (Ecdysozoa) and the close relationship of the lophophorates to molluscs and annelids (Lophotrochozoa). Many relationships remain disputed, including those that are required to polarize key features of character evolution, and support for deep nodes is often low. Phylogenomic approaches, which use data from many genes, have shown promise for resolving deep animal relationships, but are hindered by a lack of data from many important groups. Here we report a total of 39.9 Mb of expressed sequence tags from 29 animals belonging to 21 phyla, including 11 phyla previously lacking genomic or expressed-sequence-tag data. Analysed in combination with existing sequences, our data reinforce several previously identified clades that split deeply in the animal tree (including Protostomia, Ecdysozoa and Lophotrochozoa), unambiguously resolve multiple long-standing issues for which there was strong conflicting support in earlier studies with less data (such as velvet worms rather than tardigrades as the sister group of arthropods), and provide molecular support for the monophyly of molluscs, a group long recognized by morphologists. In addition, we find strong support for several new hypotheses. These include a clade that unites annelids (including sipunculans and echiurans) with nemerteans, phoronids and brachiopods, molluscs as sister to that assemblage, and the placement of ctenophores as the earliest diverging extant multicellular animals. A single origin of spiral cleavage (with subsequent losses) is inferred from well-supported nodes. Many relationships between a stable subset of taxa find strong support, and a diminishing number of lineages remain recalcitrant to placement on the tree.},

Here, we propose that this lack of resolution is rather due to the mutual cancellation of the phylogenetic signal (historical) and the nonphylogenetic signal (due to systematic errors) that results from inadequate taxon sampling and/or model of sequence evolution. Starting with a data set of comparable size, we use 3 different strategies to reduce the nonphylogenetic signal: 1) increasing the number of species; 2) replacing a fast-evolving species by a slowly evolving one; and 3) using a better model of sequence evolution. In all cases, the phylogenetic resolution is markedly improved, in agreement with our hypothesis that the originally reported lack of resolution was artifactual.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-5-113},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

In a previous paper, we introduced {MUSCLE}, a new program for creating multiple alignments of protein sequences, giving a brief summary of the algorithm and showing {MUSCLE} to achieve the highest scores reported to date on four alignment accuracy benchmarks. Here we present a more complete discussion of the algorithm, describing several previously unpublished techniques that improve biological accuracy and / or computational complexity. We introduce a new option, {MUSCLE-fast}, designed for high-throughput applications. We also describe a new protocol for evaluating objective functions that align two profiles.


{RESULTS}

We compare the speed and accuracy of {MUSCLE} with {CLUSTALW}, Progressive {POA} and the {MAFFT} script {FFTNS1}, the fastest previously published program known to the author. Accuracy is measured using four benchmarks: {BAliBASE}, {PREFAB}, {SABmark} and {SMART.} We test three variants that offer highest accuracy ({MUSCLE} with default settings), highest speed ({MUSCLE-fast)}, and a carefully chosen compromise between the two ({MUSCLE-prog).} We find {MUSCLE-fast} to be the fastest algorithm on all test sets, achieving average alignment accuracy similar to {CLUSTALW} in times that are typically two to three orders of magnitude less. {MUSCLE-fast} is able to align 1,000 sequences of average length 282 in 21 seconds on a current desktop computer.


{CONCLUSIONS}

{MUSCLE} offers a range of options that provide improved speed and / or alignment accuracy compared with currently available programs. {MUSCLE} is freely available at http://www.drive5.com/muscle.},

Orthology and paralogy are key concepts of evolutionary genomics. A clear distinction between orthologs and paralogs is critical for the construction of a robust evolutionary classification of genes and reliable functional annotation of newly sequenced genomes. Genome comparisons show that orthologous relationships with genes from taxonomically distant species can be established for the majority of the genes from each sequenced genome. This review examines in depth the definitions and subtypes of orthologs and paralogs, outlines the principal methodological approaches employed for identification of orthology and paralogy, and considers evolutionary and functional implications of these concepts.},

Parallel processing capabilities in the form of the single instruction, multiple data ({SIMD)} technology are now available in common microprocessors and enable a single microprocessor to perform many operations in parallel. The {ParAlign} algorithm has been specifically designed to take advantage of this technology. The new algorithm initially exploits parallelism to perform a very rapid computation of the exact optimal ungapped alignment score for all diagonals in the alignment matrix. Then, a novel heuristic is employed to compute an approximate score of a gapped alignment by combining the scores of several diagonals. This approximate score is used to select the most interesting database sequences for a subsequent Smith-Waterman alignment, which is also parallelised. The resulting method represents a substantial improvement compared to existing heuristics. The sensitivity and specificity of {ParAlign} was found to be as good as Smith-Waterman implementations when the same method for computing the statistical significance of the matches was used. In terms of speed, only the significantly less sensitive {NCBI} {BLAST} 2 program was found to outperform the new approach. Online searches are available at http://dna.uio.no/search/},

For taxa such as plants, with very high levels of gene duplication in their nuclear genomes, this has limited the exploitation of nuclear sequences for phylogenetic studies, such as those available in large {EST} libraries. One rarely used method of inference, gene tree parsimony, can infer species trees from gene families undergoing duplication and loss, but its performance has not been evaluated at a phylogenomic scale for {EST} data in plants. {RESULTS} A gene tree parsimony analysis based on {EST} data was undertaken for six angiosperm model species and Pinus, an outgroup. Although a large fraction of the tentative consensus sequences obtained from the {TIGR} database of {ESTs} was assembled into homologous clusters too small to be phylogenetically informative, some 557 clusters contained promising levels of information. Based on maximum likelihood estimates of the gene trees obtained from these clusters, gene tree parsimony correctly inferred the accepted species tree with strong statistical support. A slight variant of this species tree was obtained when maximum parsimony was used to infer the individual gene trees instead. {CONCLUSION} Despite the complexity of the {EST} data and the relatively small fraction eventually used in inferring a species tree, the gene tree parsimony method performed well in the face of very high apparent rates of duplication.},

As a tool for future comparative, phylogenomic and phylogenetic studies, we used both supertrees and concatenated alignments to infer relationships between 42 species of fungi for which complete genome sequences are available. {RESULTS} A dataset of 345,829 genes was extracted from 42 publicly available fungal genomes. Supertree methods were employed to derive phylogenies from 4,805 single gene families. We found that the average consensus supertree method may suffer from long-branch attraction artifacts, while matrix representation with parsimony ({MRP)} appears to be immune from these. A genome phylogeny was also reconstructed from a concatenated alignment of 153 universally distributed orthologs. Our {MRP} supertree and concatenated phylogeny are highly congruent. Within the Ascomycota, the sub-phyla Pezizomycotina and Saccharomycotina were resolved. Both phylogenies infer that the Leotiomycetes are the closest sister group to the Sordariomycetes. There is some ambiguity regarding the placement of Stagonospora nodurum, the sole member of the class Dothideomycetes present in the dataset. Within the Saccharomycotina, a monophyletic clade containing organisms that translate {CTG} as serine instead of leucine is evident. There is also strong support for two groups within the {CTG} clade, one containing the fully sexual species Candida lusitaniae, Candida guilliermondii and Debaryomyces hansenii, and the second group containing Candida albicans, Candida dubliniensis, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis and Lodderomyces elongisporus. The second major clade within the Saccharomycotina contains species whose genomes have undergone a whole genome duplication ({WGD)}, and their close relatives. We could not confidently resolve whether Candida glabrata or Saccharomyces castellii lies at the base of the {WGD} clade. {CONCLUSION} We have constructed robust phylogenies for fungi based on whole genome analysis. Overall, our phylogenies provide strong support for the classification of phyla, sub-phyla, classes and orders. We have resolved the relationship of the classes Leotiomyctes and Sordariomycetes, and have identified two classes within the {CTG} clade of the Saccharomycotina that may correlate with sexual status.},

	abstract = {The evolution of multicellular animals (Metazoa) from their unicellular ancestors was a key transition that was accompanied by the emergence and diversification of gene families associated with multicellularity. To clarify the timing and order of specific events in this transition, we conducted expressed sequence tag surveys on 4 putative protistan relatives of Metazoa including the choanoflagellate Monosiga ovata, the ichthyosporeans Sphaeroforma arctica and Amoebidium parasiticum, and the amoeba Capsaspora owczarzaki, and 2 members of Amoebozoa, Acanthamoeba castellanii and Mastigamoeba balamuthi. We find that homologs of genes involved in metazoan multicellularity exist in several of these unicellular organisms, including 1 encoding a membrane-associated guanylate kinase with an inverted arrangement of protein-protein interaction domains ({MAGI)} in Capsaspora. In Metazoa, {MAGI} regulates tight junctions involved in cell-cell communication. By phylogenomic analyses of genes encoded in nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, we show that the choanoflagellates are the closest relatives of the Metazoa, followed by the Capsaspora and Ichthyosporea lineages, although the branching order between the latter 2 groups remains unclear. Understanding the function of "metazoan-specific" proteins we have identified in these protists will clarify the evolutionary steps that led to the emergence of the Metazoa.},

Here, we use small {EST} libraries ({\textless}1,000 clones) to generate phylogenetic markers across a broad sample of insects, focusing on the species-rich Coleoptera (beetles). We sequenced over 23,000 {ESTs} from 34 taxa, which produced 8,728 unique sequences after clustering nonredundant sequences. Between taxa, the sequences could be grouped into 731 gene clusters, with the largest corresponding to mitochondrial {DNA} transcripts and gene families chymotrypsin, actin, troponin, and tubulin. While levels of paralogy were high in most gene clusters, several midsized clusters including many ribosomal protein ({RP)} genes appeared to be free of expressed paralogs. To evaluate the utility of {EST} data for molecular systematics, we curated available transcripts for 66 {RP} genes from representatives of the major groups of Coleoptera. Using supertree and supermatrix approaches for phylogenetic analysis, the results were consistent with the emerging phylogenetic conclusions about basal relationships in Coleoptera. Numerous small {EST} libraries from a taxonomically densely sampled lineage can provide a core set of genes that together act as a scaffold in phylogenetic reconstruction, comparative genomics, and studies of gene evolution.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION} The complete sequencing of many genomes has made it possible to identify orthologous genes descending from a common ancestor. However, reconstruction of evolutionary history over long time periods faces many challenges due to gene duplications and losses. Identification of orthologous groups shared by multiple proteomes therefore becomes a clustering problem in which an optimal compromise between conflicting evidences needs to be found. {RESULTS} Here we present a new proteome-scale analysis program called {MultiParanoid} that can automatically find orthology relationships between proteins in multiple proteomes. The software is an extension of the {InParanoid} program that identifies orthologs and inparalogs in pairwise proteome comparisons. {MultiParanoid} applies a clustering algorithm to merge multiple pairwise ortholog groups from {InParanoid} into multi-species ortholog groups. To avoid outparalogs in the same cluster, {MultiParanoid} only combines species that share the same last ancestor. To validate the clustering technique, we compared the results to a reference set obtained by manual phylogenetic analysis. We further compared the results to ortholog groups in {KOGs} and {OrthoMCL}, which revealed that {MultiParanoid} produces substantially fewer outparalogs than these resources. {AVAILABILITY} {MultiParanoid} is a freely available standalone program that enables efficient orthology analysis much needed in the post-genomic era. A web-based service providing access to the original datasets, the resulting groups of orthologs, and the source code of the program can be found at http://multiparanoid.cgb.ki.se.},

	abstract = {Delineating ancestral gene relations among a large set of sequenced eukaryotic genomes allowed us to rigorously examine links between evolutionary and functional traits. We classified 86\% of over 1.36 million protein-coding genes from 40 vertebrates, 23 arthropods, and 32 fungi into orthologous groups and linked over 90\% of them to Gene Ontology or {InterPro} annotations. Quantifying properties of ortholog phyletic retention, copy-number variation, and sequence conservation, we examined correlations with gene essentiality and functional traits. More than half of vertebrate, arthropod, and fungal orthologs are universally present across each lineage. These universal orthologs are preferentially distributed in groups with almost all single-copy or all multicopy genes, and sequence evolution of the predominantly single-copy orthologous groups is markedly more constrained. Essential genes from representative model organisms, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are significantly enriched in universal orthologs within each lineage, and essential-gene-containing groups consistently exhibit greater sequence conservation than those without. This study of eukaryotic gene repertoire evolution identifies shared fundamental principles and highlights lineage-specific features, it also confirms that essential genes are highly retained and conclusively supports the "knockout-rate prediction" of stronger constraints on essential gene sequence evolution. However, the distinction between sequence conservation of single- versus multicopy orthologs is quantitatively more prominent than between orthologous groups with and without essential genes. The previously underappreciated difference in the tolerance of gene duplications and contrasting evolutionary modes of "single-copy control" versus "multicopy license" may reflect a major evolutionary mechanism that allows extended exploration of gene sequence space.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION} Phylogenomics integrates the vast amount of phylogenetic information contained in complete genome sequences, and is rapidly becoming the standard for reliably inferring species phylogenies. There are, however, fundamental differences between the ways in which phylogenomic approaches like gene content, superalignment, superdistance and supertree integrate the phylogenetic information from separate orthologous groups. Furthermore, they all depend on the method by which the orthologous groups are initially determined. Here, we systematically compare these four phylogenomic approaches, in parallel with three approaches for large-scale orthology determination: pairwise orthology, cluster orthology and tree-based orthology. {RESULTS} Including various phylogenetic methods, we apply a total of 54 fully automated phylogenomic procedures to the fungi, the eukaryotic clade with the largest number of sequenced genomes, for which we retrieved a golden standard phylogeny from the literature. Phylogenomic trees based on gene content show, relative to the other methods, a bias in the tree topology that parallels convergence in lifestyle among the species compared, indicating convergence in gene content. {CONCLUSIONS} Complete genomes are no guarantee for good or even consistent phylogenies. However, the large amounts of data in genomes enable us to carefully select the data most suitable for phylogenomic inference. In terms of performance, the superalignment approach, combined with restrictive orthology, is the most successful in recovering a fungal phylogeny that agrees with current taxonomic views, and allows us to obtain a high-resolution phylogeny. We provide solid support for what has grown to be a common practice in phylogenomics during its advance in recent years. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION} Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The model used is a discrete-state, discrete-outcome version of a general model for non-stationary time series proposed by Kitagawa (1987). A smoothing algorithm is described which can be used to reconstruct the hidden process and produce graphic displays of the compositional structure of a sequence. The problem of parameter estimation is approached using likelihood methods and an {EM} algorithm for approximating the maximum likelihood estimate is derived. The methods are applied to sequences from yeast mitochondrial {DNA}, human and mouse mitochondrial {DNAs}, a human X chromosomal fragment and the complete genome of bacteriophage lambda.},

@article{gerstein1994,
	title = {Volume changes in protein evolution},
	volume = {236},
	abstract = {We have determined the variations in volume that occur during evolution in the buried core of three different families of proteins. The variation of the whole core is very small (∼2·5\%) compared to the variation at individual sites (∼ 13\%). However, by comparing our results to those expected from random sequences with no correlations between sites,, we show that the small variation observed may simply be a manifestation of the statistical “law of large numbers” and not reflect any compensating changes in, or global constraints upon, protein sequences.

We have also analysed in detail the volume variations at individual sites, both in the core and on the surface, and compared these variations with those expected from random sequences. Individual sites on the surface have nearly the same variation as random sequences (24\% versus 28\% variation). However, individual sites in the core have about half the variation of random sequences (13\% versus 30\%). Roughly, half of these core sites strongly conserve their volume (0 to 10\% variation): one quarter have moderate variation (10 to 20\%): and the remaining quarter vary randomly (20 to 40\%).

Our results have clear implications for the relationship between protein sequence and structure. For our analysis, we have developed a new and simple method for weighting protein sequences to correct for unequal representation, which we describe in an Appendix.},
