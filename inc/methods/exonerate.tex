Exonerate \citep{slater2005} is a generic tool for pairwise nucleotide or amino
acid sequence comparison.  It allows nucleotide or amino acid sequence
alignments using many alignment models, using either exhaustive dynamic
programming or a variety of heuristics (description from
\url{http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~guy/exonerate}). In contrast to the older alternative
program Genewise \citep{birney2004}, Exonerate is not only faster by a
three-digit factor depending on the data and the applied search algorithm, but
also provides frameshift-corrected, nucleotide output when aligning transcripts
to a related amino acid sequence. Finally, it provides a flexible output format
specification.

Exonerate is written in C and published under the GPL. It is available in binary
form for 32-bit and 64-bit platforms as well as in source code. I downloaded the
source code, compiled it with GCC, and installed the binaries locally.
