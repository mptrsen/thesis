Exonerate \citep{slater2005} is a generic tool for pairwise sequence comparison.
It allows sequence alignments using many alignment models, using either
exhaustive dynamic programming, or a variety of heuristics (description from
\url{http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~guy/exonerate}). In contrast to its predecessor
Genewise \citep{birney2004}, which is no longer under development, Exonerate is
not only faster by a two-digit factor depending on the data, but also allows
frameshift-corrected, corresponding nucleotide output when aligning amino acid
sequences, and provides a flexible output format specification.

Exonerate is written in C and published under the GPL. It is available in binary
form for 32-bit and 64-bit platforms as well as in source code. I downloaded the
source code, compiled it with GCC and installed the binaries locally.
