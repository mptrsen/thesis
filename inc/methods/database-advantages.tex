\pname uses a MySQL relational database management system (RDBMS) for fast and
efficient sequence data storage and retrieval. The introduction of a RDBMS has a
number of advantages over file-based sequence storage:

\begin{description}
	\item[Memory efficiency.] The sequence data does not need to be loaded into
		RAM for fast access since the DBMS manages sequence storage and retrieval.
		This becomes especially important when analyzing data files larger than the
		computer's physical memory.
	\item[No redundancy.] Every sequence and each orthology relationship is stored
		in the database exactly once with a unique identifier. 
	\item[Speed.] The DBMS is highly optimized for speed and efficiency. If
		configured correctly, complex joins comprising millions of rows are
		executed quickly due to the use of B-tree indices.  %TODO MySQL performance
	\item[Flexibility.] SQL queries allow custom-tailored filtering and output.
