All program code was written in Perl. Only core modules were used, i.e., modules
that are present in any standard Perl distribution (see table \ref{tab:modules}),
with the exception of \code{IO::Tee} \citep{shan2001}, which was downloaded from
the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network
(CPAN\footnote{\url{http://search.cpan.org}}) and bundled with \pname. All other
modules were custom-written by me.

Well aware of the fact that with BioPerl\footnote{\url{http://www.bioperl.org}}
there exists an extensive library of Perl modules for bioinformatic tasks, I
chose to write my own wrapper modules. BioPerl provides an exhaustive,
object-oriented interface to biological sequence handling and wrappers for
various programs, including HMMER3 and BLAST. However, BioPerl has not always
been bug-free (Niehuis and Misof 2011, pers. comm.). In addition, its multiple
layers of object-oriented abstraction carry a lot of overhead, which I wanted to
avoid if possible. These points convinced me not to rely on the BioPerl wrapper
libraries for the programs in this pipeline, but to write them from scratch.
This ensures a minimum of overhead while providing the required features and
maximum control.
