The program \pname, that I developed and that I present here and all related
helper scripts were written in Perl. When using existing Perl modules written
by others, I only relied on core modules, \ie, modules that are present in any
standard Perl distribution (see table \ref{tab:modules}), with the exception of
\code{IO::Tee} \citep{shan2001}, which was downloaded from the Comprehensive
Perl Archive Network (CPAN\footnote{\url{http://search.cpan.org}}) and bundled
with \pname. All other modules were custom-written by me.

Well aware of the fact that with BioPerl\footnote{\url{http://www.bioperl.org}}
there exists an extensive library of Perl modules for bioinformatic tasks, I
chose to write my own wrapper modules. BioPerl provides an exhaustive,
object-oriented interface to biological sequence handling and wrappers for
various programs, including HMMER3, Exonerate and BLAST. However, I wanted
\pname to remain as independent as possible from the development of other
software packages. In addition, BioPerl's multiple layers of object-oriented
abstraction carry a lot of overhead, which I wanted to avoid if possible. This
ensures a minimum of overhead while providing the required features and maximum
control.
