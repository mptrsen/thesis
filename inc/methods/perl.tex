All program code was written in Perl. Only core modules were used, i.e., modules
that are present in any standard Perl distribution (see table \ref{tab:modules}),
with the exception of \code{IO::Tee} by Chung-chieh Shan, which was downloaded
from \url{http://search.cpan.org/~kenshan/IO-Tee-0.64/Tee.pm} and bundled with
\pname. All other modules were custom-written by me.

Well aware of the fact that with BioPerl (\url{http://www.bioperl.org}) there
exists an extensive library of Perl modules for bioinformatic tasks, I wrote my
own wrapper modules. BioPerl provides an exhaustive, object-oriented interface
to biological sequence handling and wrappers for various programs, including
HMMER3 and BLAST. However, BioPerl has not always been bug-free (Niehuis and
Misof, pers. comm.). In addition, its multiple layers of object-oriented
abstraction carry a lot of overhead, which I would like to avoid if possible.
These points convinced me not to rely on the BioPerl wrapper libraries for the
programs in this pipeline, but to write them from scratch. This ensures a
minimum of overhead while providing the required features and maximum control.
