The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool BLAST \citep{altschul1990} searches for
regions of local similarity between nucleotide or amino acid sequences. The
program compares nucleotide or amino acid sequences to databases of amino acid
or nucleotide sequences and calculates the statistical significance of matches.
BLAST can be used to infer functional and evolutionary relationships between
sequences as well as help identify members of gene families (description from
\url{http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov}).

The NCBI BLAST+ package is written in C++ and published under a public domain
license. It is available in binary form for various 32-bit and 64-bit platforms
as well as in source code from the \nomenclature{NCBI}{National Center for
Biotechnology Information} website. I downloaded the 64-bit Linux binary version
and installed it locally.
