The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool BLAST \citep{altschul1990} finds regions
of local similarity between sequences. The program compares nucleotide or
protein sequences to sequence databases and calculates the statistical
significance of matches. BLAST can be used to infer functional and evolutionary
relationships between sequences as well as help identify members of gene
families (description from \url{http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov}).

The NCBI BLAST+ package is written in C++ and published under a public domain
license. It is available in binary form for various 32-bit and 64-bit platforms
as well as in source code from the NCBI website. I downloaded the 64-bit Linux
binary version and installed it locally.
