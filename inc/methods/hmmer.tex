HMMER3  \citep{eddy2011} is a software package used for searching sequence
databases for homologs of protein sequences, and for making protein sequence
alignments. It implements methods using pHMMs as described in
\autoref{sec:hmms}.

Compared to BLAST, and other sequence alignment and database search tools based
on older scoring methodology, HMMER aims to be significantly more accurate and
more able to detect remote homologs because of the strength of its underlying
mathematical models. In the past, this strength came at significant
computational expense, but in the new HMMER3 project, HMMER is now essentially
as fast as BLAST (description from \url{http://hmmer.janelia.org}).

HMMER3 is written in C and published under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
It is available in binary form for 32-bit and 64-bit platforms and as source
code from the site of the developers. I downloaded the source code, compiled it
with GCC and installed the binaries locally.
