HMMER3  \citep{eddy2011} is a software package used for searching amino acid
sequence databases for homologs of proteins, and for aligning multiple amino
acid sequences. It implements methods using HMMs as described in
\autoref{sec:hmms}.

Compared to BLAST and other sequence alignment and database search tools based
on older scoring methodology, HMMER aims to be significantly more accurate and
more able to detect remote homologs because of the strength of its underlying
mathematical models. In the past, this strength came at significant
computational expense, but in the new HMMER3 project, HMMER is now essentially
as fast as BLAST (description from \url{http://hmmer.janelia.org}).

HMMER3 is written in C and published under the GNU General Public License
(\nomenclature{GPL}{GNU General Public License}). It is available in binary
form for 32-bit and 64-bit platforms and as source code from the site of the
developers. I downloaded the source code, compiled it with GCC, and installed
the binaries locally\footnote{The package is called HMMER3 and contains a number
of programs. The program that is used to search a amino acid sequence database
for alignments using a HMM is called \tool{hmmsearch}.}.
