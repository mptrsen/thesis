HMMER3 (\cite{eddy2011}) is written in C and published under the GNU General
Public License (GPL). It is available in binary form for 32-bit and 64-bit
platforms and as source code from the site of the developers.  I downloaded the
source code, compiled it with the GNU C compiler (GCC) and installed the binaries
locally.
