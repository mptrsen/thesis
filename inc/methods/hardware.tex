The here presented software was programmed, tested and analyzed on a standard
desktop computer equipped with an Intel \mbox{Core 2 Duo} E8500 CPU clocked at
3.16 GHz and 4 GB of RAM running Fedora, a general-purpose Linux
distribution\footnote{\url{http://www.fedoraproject.com}}, with the most recent
64-bit Linux kernel (3.6.10 at the time of this writing). The only exception was
the testing of HMM specificity (\autoref{sec:hmmtest}), which for performance
reasons was run on the HPC cluster at the ZFMK in Bonn. This cluster consists of
6 HP ProLiant blade servers with 12 Intel Xeon dual-core CPUs clocked at 2.67
GHz and 96 GB of RAM each, running
Rocks\footnote{\url{http://www.rocksclusters.org}}, a specialized Linux
distribution for massively parallel processing on HPC clusters, with the 64-bit
Linux kernel version 2.6.32.
