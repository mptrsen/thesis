All testing and analysis steps were performed on a standard desktop computer
equipped with an Intel \mbox{Core 2 Duo} E8500 CPU clocked at 3.16 GHz and 4 GB
of RAM running Fedora Linux with the most recent 64-bit kernel (3.6.10 at the
time of this writing). The only exception was the testing of HMM specificity
(\ref{sec:hmmtest}), which ran on the HPC cluster at the ZFMK in Bonn. This
cluster consists of 6 HP ProLiant blade servers with \todo{get specs!}
