The here presented software was programmed, tested and analyzed on a standard
desktop computer equipped with an Intel \mbox{Core 2 Duo} E8500
\nomenclature{CPU}{Central processing unit} clocked at 3.16
\nomenclature{GHz}{Gigahertz} and 4 \nomenclature{GB}{Gigabyte} of
\nomenclature{RAM}{Random access memory} running Fedora, a general-purpose Linux
distribution\footnote{\url{http://www.fedoraproject.com}}, with the most recent
64-bit Linux kernel (3.6.10 at the time of this writing). The only exception was
the testing of HMM specificity (\autoref{sec:hmmtest}), which for performance
reasons was run on the \nomenclature{HPC}{High performance computing} cluster at
the \nomenclature{ZFMK}{Zoologisches Forschungsmuseum A. Koenig} in Bonn. This
cluster consists of 6 \nomenclature{HP}{Hewlett-Packard} ProLiant blade servers
with 12 Intel Xeon dual-core CPUs clocked at 2.67 GHz and 96 GB of RAM each,
running Rocks\footnote{\url{http://www.rocksclusters.org}}, a specialized Linux
distribution for massively parallel processing on HPC clusters, with the 64-bit
Linux kernel version 2.6.32.
