All testing and analysis steps were performed on a standard desktop computer
equipped with an Intel \mbox{Core 2 Duo} E8500 CPU clocked at 3.16 GHz and 4 GB
of RAM running Fedora Linux with the most recent 64-bit kernel (3.6.10 at the
time of this writing). The only exception was the testing of HMM specificity
(\autoref{sec:hmmtest}), which for performance reasons was run on the HPC
cluster at the ZFMK in Bonn. This cluster consists of 6 HP ProLiant blade
servers with 12 Intel Xeon dual-core CPUs clocked at 2.67 GHz and 96 GB of RAM
each, running Rocks Linux, a specialized cluster distribution, with the 64-bit
kernel version 2.6.32.
