		BBH triangulation. To identify genes as orthologous in the presence of
		potential gene loss or incomplete data, they must be BBH in three species.
		In this example, the red gene fulfills this criterion. The blue gene cannot
		be unambiguously identified as orthologous, as it is not present in the frog
		and paralogy is possible (compare to \autoref{fig:graph-based-strat}).
