When reconstructing species lineages, so called homologous characters are used
to reconstruct ancestral trees. The term homolog was introduced in 1848
(\cite{owen1848}) and was used to describe ``the same organ in different animals
under different every variety of form and function''. Similarly, analogs were
defined as ``part or organ in one animal which has the same function as another
part or organ in a different animal''. At that time, Owen had no notion of the
concept of evolution, and in the famous \emph{Origin of Species}
(\cite{darwin1859}), the term homology is never used, but in a review
(\cite{owen1860}), he refers to homology as evidence of evolution.

A morphological character is the phenotypic reflection of a molecular character.
Since molecular genetics entered the field of phylogenetics during the 1960s,
these are used in numerous studies on species lineages.  Molecular characters,
such as genes, are homologous if they share a common origin. However, this is
not sufficient to infer reliable phylogenies based on molecular data. Genes can
be subject to a number of events in the course of their evolutionary history,
such as speciation, gene duplication, gene loss, horizontal gene transfer as
well as fusion, fission and other rearrangements of genes (\cite{koonin2005}).
These different types of relatedness between molecular sequences have made new
definitions necessary (see figure \ref{fig:orthology}).

Homologous genes that are related by a speciation event are called
\emph{orthologs} (\cite{fitch1970}). They reflect species phylogeny directly and
are most commonly used to infer species lineages. \emph{Paralogous} genes are
also homologous, but they are related by a gene duplication event and are not
involved in horizontal radiation. Further distinction must be made among
paralogous genes (\cite{sonnhammer2002}): paralogous genes that are related by a
lineage-specific duplication are called \emph{outparalogs} if the duplication
occurred prior to a given speciation event, while genes that result from a
lineage-specific duplication subsequent to a given speciation event are called
\emph{inparalogs}.  These distinctions are important when looking at internal
branches of a phylogenetic tree.

A fourth subtype of homology is called \emph{xenology}. It is defined as the
condition in which the history of the genes involves horizontal, or
interspecies, gene transfer (\cite{gray1983}). This is the only form of homology
in which the gene lineage cannot be traced back to a parent, but instead from
one organism to another.

In molecular phylogenetics, orthologous sequences are used to reconstruct
species lineages, because these sequences are the only homologous sequences
whose phylogeny reflects the genealogical relationships of the species from
which the sequences were obtained. Orthologs are also used to study mechanisms
of gene and genome evolution (\cite{dessimoz2012}). Orthologs tend to be more
functionally similar than paralogs (\cite{altenhoff2012}); this is the so-called
\emph{ortholog conjecture} (\cite{tatusov1997}) and the reason why the analysis
of protein families often requires orthology among the investigated genes. In
addition, housekeeping genes, i.e., genes that are essential to keeping an
organism alive, underlie stronger sequence conservation due to selection
pressure (\cite{she2009}) and are more likely to be orthologous across species
(\cite{waterhouse2011}).
