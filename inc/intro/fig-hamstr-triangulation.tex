		\textbf{a)} The transcript sequence space is searched using a hidden Markov
			model (HMM), which is a statistical representation of the reference
			sequences that were used to build it.
		\textbf{b)} A reference proteome is searched using the match sequence from the
			HMM search (reciprocal search).
		\textbf{c)} If the reciprocal search match sequence is one that was used to
			build the HMM, then orthology is assumed.
