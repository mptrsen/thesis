	\caption[A simple hidden Markov model]{A simple, two-state hidden Markov model
		(HMM) describing a DNA sequence with a heterogeneous base composition. 
		\textbf{a)} State 1 generates AT-rich sequences. State 2 generates CG-rich
			sequences (so-called CpG islands). State transitions and their respective
			probabilities are indicated by arrows. Symbol emission probabilities for
			each state are listed below the states. State transition probabilities
			and emission probabilities are model parameters.
		\textbf{b)} At each position, the model not only emits a symbol (\eg, a
			nucleotide character) with a probability that is dependent on its state, it
			also transits to the other state with a certain probability, or remains in
			the present state.
		\textbf{c)} The symbol sequence is the result of the state transitions and
			the emission probabilities in those states.
