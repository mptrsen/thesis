			\item In the evolutionary scenario of a gene family with two speciation
				events S\textsubscript{1} and S\textsubscript{2} and one duplication event
				D\textsubscript{1}, the frog gene is orthologous to all other genes. The
				red and blue genes are orthologs among themselves, but paralogs to each
				other.
			\item The corresponding graph. Genes are represented as circles and
				evolutionary relationships by edges. While the red and blue genes form
				one-to-one relationships among themselves, the frog gene has a one-to-many
				relationship to the red and blue genes. A bidirectional best hit search
				strategy would detect only the highest scoring one of these pairs.
