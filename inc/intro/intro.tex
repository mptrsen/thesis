Since the advent of molecular sequencing techniques and the reconstruction of
phylogenies based on nucleic or amino acid sequences, homology is still a
required, but no longer a sufficient criterion for comparing characters.
So-called orthologs allow retracing speciation events in a phylogenetic context.
Common orthology prediction techniques that are applied to genomes or proteomes,
however, cannot be applied to transcriptomic sequence data because of its
inherent incompleteness. In the present thesis, I establish a software pipeline
for orthology prediction in transcriptome data.
