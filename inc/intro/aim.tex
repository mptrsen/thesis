All the issues mentioned in the previous subsection converge to the necessity of
implementing the approach used in \hamstr in a new, user-friendly software
solution. In the present thesis, I infer a software pipeline for gene orthology
prediction in transcriptomic sequence data that is easy to use by employing
configuration files and automatically generating ortholog sets from provided
information, faster by relying on only the necessary external tools, and more
flexible and modern by incorporating up-to-date technology. A modular design
will facilitate future extension as well as multithreaded implementation to
benefit from parallel computing environments for additional speed.
