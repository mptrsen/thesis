			\item The transcript sequence space is searched using a hidden Markov
				model (HMM), which is a statistical representation of the reference
				sequences that were used to build it.
			\item A reference proteome is searched using the match sequence from the
				HMM search (reciprocal search).
			\item If the reciprocal search match sequence is one that was used to
				build the HMM, then orthology is assumed.
