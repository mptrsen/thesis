\label{sec:hmms}
Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are statistical models that are generally applicable
to ``linear'' problems. For this property, HMMs have seen widespread use in
temporal pattern recognition algorithms, such as speech and gesture recognition
or musical score following for over thirty years before they were introduced
into computational biology by \citet{churchill1989} and used as profile models
since the 1990s \citep{krogh1994}.

Their statistical, linear nature makes them very useful for application on
biological sequences.



Proteins, RNAs and other biological molecular sequences can usually be
classified into families of related sequences and structures
(\cite{henikoff1997}).
