\emph{Mutation:} it is the key to our evolution. It has enabled us to evolve
from a single-celled organism into the dominant species on the planet. This
process is slow, and normally taking thousands and thousands of years. But
every few hundred millennia, evolution leaps forward. (\cite{singer2000}) \end{quote}

``The situation is no different in the realms of biology. The three
levels correspond to:
\begin{equation*}
God - DNA - Forms.
\end{equation*}
If we adopt the neo-Darwinian structures of change (mutation and selection), we
cannot predict history through them, since such structures imply accumulation
of random little changes. God cannot make use of DNA to design forms (proteins,
organisms, etc.) because DNA operates in a too complex and non-linear way to
allow prediction of forms starting from molecules. Biology has become a
self-elaborating molecular theory. We do not need God and we do not take any
interest in forms: DNA is enough for us.`` (\cite{Sermonti2006})
