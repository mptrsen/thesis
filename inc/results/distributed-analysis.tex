The server-client model of MySQL enables a distributed analysis on a computer
network. This is advantageous on either a HPC cluster designed for massively
parallelized computing, where many physical computers are connected in a
low-latency network and communicate with each other, or a network of standard
desktop computers, where the clients communicate with the server only. In either
environment, one computer acts (or multiple computers act: in high-performance
database applications, so-called federated databases are distributed across many
servers) as a central database server, and the others connect to it over the
network. This requires appropriate server configuration to allow remote
connections.

When using a multi-client setup with standard desktop computers like described
above, it is beneficial to designate one computer exclusively for the MySQL
server instance, and not run \pname analyses on that machine. The large amount
of data that is sent to and from the server, and the overhead due to table
(re-)indexing take up the majority of the CPU capacity. In order to not hinder
the other computer's analysis, the server computer should be able to dedicate
its entire resources to managing the MySQL database. MySQL itself is
multithreaded and scales well over many processors, and can handle hundreds of
simultaneous connections per second without problems.
