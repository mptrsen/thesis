The server-client model of MySQL enables a distributed analysis on a computer
network. This is advantageous on either a HPC cluster designed for massively
parallelized computing, where many physical computers are connected in a
low-latency network and communicate with each other, or a network of standard
desktop computers. In either environment, one computer (or more: in
high-performance database applications, so-called federated databases are
distributed across many servers) functions as a database server, and the others
connect to it over the network.
