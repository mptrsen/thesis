		\pname database structure. Each rounded rectangle represents a table with
		named columns. Note the circular path (red) that can be drawn across the
		tables and that is used in queries across multiple tables in order to
		construct a graph of orthologous relationships. Green table columns are
		referenced to the ``taxa'' table, and yellow table columns are referenced to
		the ``types'' table. Dotted lines are secondary references that provide
		additional information for individual records.
