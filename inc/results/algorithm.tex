The \pname package consists of three separate tools:

\begin{description}
	\item[orthograph-manager] is a helper application intended for management of
		the database. It is intended to create the initial database structure, upload
		ortholog sets and nucleotide or amino acid sequence data and manage present
		ortholog sets.
	\item[orthograph-analyzer] is the actual pipeline that performs the
		bidirectional searches using \tool{hmmsearch} and BLAST. It loads the
		results into the database, but does not attempt to infer ortholog
		relationships. 
	\item[orthograph-reporter] is the reporting program that fetches the data that
		\tool{orthograph-analyzer} stored in the database and establishes ortholog
		relationships by means of an iterative algorithm (see
		\autoref{sec:algorithm-reporting}).
\end{description}

In the following subsections, the algorithms for analysis and evaluation are
outlined in detail.
