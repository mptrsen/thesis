The results of this thesis are contained mostly in the code I have written for
\pname, and in the knowledge that I gained during its development. 

The graph-based approach to orthology prediction is in principle a simple
algorithm and easy to implement, but in practice offers not only technical
challenges when applied on a large scale such as on the 1,000 transcriptome data
for the 1KITE\footnote{\url{http://1kite.org}} project, but also numerous
opportunities for extension and improvement. In the following, I will elaborate
on both.
