		Non-redundant assignment of ortholog relationships. The ortholog groups (OG)
		are connected to the candidate hit transcripts by the e-value of the HMM
		search. Traversing the graph by ascending e-value and assigning the
		transcripts to the OG with the best hit results in transcript 3 being
		assigned to OG B, transcript 4 to OG C and transcript 2 to OG A. Transcript
		1 remains unassigned because the \tool{hmmsearch} e-value for OG A is higher than
		the e-value for transcript 2.
