In \pname, not only the e-value threshold for both the \tool{hmmsearch} and
BLAST searches define a criterion that must be met in order for a transcript to
be considered orthologous to a given OG. Here, a so-called \emph{soft threshold}
is introduced: When traversing the graph by ascending \tool{hmmsearch} e-value
edges, it may happen that, for a given OG--transcript combination, multiple
BLAST searches that are consecutive in e-value did not hit an amino acid
sequence that was used to build the HMM for this OG. In \pname, the soft
threshold defines a number of reciprocal searches for a single OG that did not
fulfill the triangulation criterion. Above the soft threshold, the reliability
of this ortholog relationship is considered insufficient, and the given OG is
skipped (for that given \tool{hmmsearch} e-value).
