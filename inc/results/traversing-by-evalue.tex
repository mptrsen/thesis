The \pname algorithm is different from the one that is implemented in \hamstr:
It does not assign transcript sequences to ortholog groups (OG) based on a
per-OG basis, but instead first collects all possible graph edges (see
\autoref{fig:graph}) and traverses them by ascending hmmsearch e-value. This has
two obvious advantages: firstly, it assures that the transcript sequences are
mapped to the most relevant OG, and not the one that was processed first.
Secondly, by removing the transcript sequences from the list of candidate
transcripts, it precludes redundant assignment, \ie, the same transcript being
mapped to multiple OGs or vice versa.
