\pname is a graph-based approach to orthology prediction. The graph draws
ortholog relationships between transcripts and known orthologous groups (figure
\ref{fig:graph}).

		Transcript sequences from a large sequence space are mapped to ortholog
		groups (OG, in circles). Since the transcript sequences are fragmented, multiple
		transcripts may extend a single ortholog cluster.
