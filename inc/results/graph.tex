\label{sec:graph}
\pname is a graph-based approach to orthology prediction. The graph draws
ortholog relationships between transcripts and known ortholog groups (figure
\ref{fig:graph} on page \pageref{fig:graph}) according to the algorithm outlined
in \autoref{sec:algorithm}.  Transcript sequences are clustered to ortholog
groups by means of a triangulation strategy using reference proteomes as
explained in \autoref{sec:hamstr}. The triangular relationships are evaluated
using a iterative approach as explained in \autoref{sec:algorithm}. This results
in a graph as shown in \autoref{fig:orthograph-graph} on page
\pageref{fig:orthograph-graph}.
