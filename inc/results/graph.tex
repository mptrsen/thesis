\pname is a graph-based approach to orthology prediction. The graph draws
ortholog relationships between transcripts and known orthologous groups (figure
\ref{fig:graph}).

		graph. Transcript sequences from a large sequence space are assigned to
		ortholog groups (in circles). Since the transcript sequences are fragmented,
		multiple transcripts may be assigned to a single ortholog group.}
