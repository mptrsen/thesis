\label{sec:graph}
\pname is a graph-based approach to orthology prediction. The graph draws
ortholog relationships between transcripts and known ortholog groups (figure
\ref{fig:graph}). Transcript sequences are clustered to ortholog groups by means
of a triangulation strategy using reference proteomes as explained in
\autoref{sec:hamstr}.
