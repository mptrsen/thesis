The graph that is constructed by \pname in order to assess ortholog
relationships between transcripts and known ortholog groups is shown in
\autoref{fig:orthograph-graph} on page \pageref{fig:graph}. It is inferred
according to the algorithm outlined in \autoref{sec:algorithm}. Transcript
sequences are clustered to ortholog groups by means of a triangulation strategy
using reference proteomes as explained in \autoref{sec:hamstr}. The triangular
relationships are evaluated using a iterative approach as explained in
\autoref{sec:algorithm}. This results in a graph as shown in
\autoref{fig:orthograph-graph} on page \pageref{fig:orthograph-graph}.
