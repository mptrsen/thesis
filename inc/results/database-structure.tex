The database was designed in a way that reduces redundant information to a
minimum. The structure diagram is shown in Figure \ref{fig:dbstructure} (page
\pageref{fig:dbstructure}). At the time of this writing, the tables ``ests'',
``hmmsearch'' and ``blast'' are filled in a cumulative fashion, i.e., they
contain data from all query species. This affects performance because without
administrative access to server configuration and tuning variables, a too small
InnoDB key buffer becomes a performance bottleneck \citep{mysql2013}.
