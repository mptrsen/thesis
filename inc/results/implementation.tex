\subsubsection{Removing hits from the candidate list eliminates redundancy}

In order to avoid redundant assignment, i.e., a single transcript being assigned
to multiple ortholog groups or vice versa, candidate pairs that have been
verified are removed from the list of candidates.

	\caption[Non-redundant assignment]{The ortholog groups (OG) are connected to
		the candidate hit transcripts by the e-value of the HMM search. Traversing
		the graph by e-value and assigning the transcripts to the OG with the best
		hit results in transcript 2 being assigned to OG A, transcript 3 to OG B and
		transcript 4 to OG C. Transcript 1 remains unassigned because the HMM search
		e-value for OG A is higher than the e-value for transcript 2.}
