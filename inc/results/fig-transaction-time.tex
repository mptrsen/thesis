\caption[Re-indexing performance on MyISAM tables]{
	Re-indexing performance on MyISAM tables. Starting with about $5.5\times10^6$
	rows in the table ``ests'', MyISAM re-indexing performance starts to drop.
	The indices had been disabled prior to data upload in order to improve upload
	performance. A solution to this problem is to split up the table ``ests'' into
	separate tables for each query taxon.
