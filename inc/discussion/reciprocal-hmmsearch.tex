As hinted in the introduction (\autoref{sec:improvements}), using BLAST for the
reciprocal search step may be interpreted as a waste of specificity: why put
effort into employing HMMs for their capability of finding remotely related
amino acid sequences during the forward search, when the candidate ortholog may
be discarded later because BLAST is much stricter than a HMM search? This design
decision in \hamstr is puzzling, but alternative search algorithms could not
easily be implemented in the pipeline. This has changed with \pname: its modular
design facilitates extension and also switching to a different reciprocal search
algorithm in order to test whether the employment of a HMM-based tool for both
search directions might provide better results.
