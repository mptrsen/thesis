In its present state, \pname has been tested to work as described. However, the
triangulation approach that was treaded by \pname's archetype \hamstr, offers
numerous opportunities to future extension. The modular design of \pname
facilitates integration of different algorithms as well as modification and
exchange of existing modules in order to implement improved methods.
