	Soft threshold. The BLAST hits are sorted by e-value and are traversed in
	ascending order. With a soft threshold of 2, the ortholog candidate in
	question would be discarded after the fourth BLAST hit, which does not occur
	in the OG. In \hamstr under a strict setting, the candidate would be discarded
	after the second BLAST hit.
