\label{sec:table-per-species}
At the time of this writing, the tables ``ests'', ``hmmsearch'' and ``blast''
are filled in a cumulative fashion, \ie, they contain data from all query
species. This affects performance because without administrative access to
server configuration and tuning variables, a too small InnoDB key buffer along
with very large tables becomes a performance bottleneck \citep{mysql2013}. For
this reason---and because \pname is intended for users with no knowledge about
MySQL administration, and therefore fine-tuning of server variables in order to
adapt to the amount of data at hand is not possible---future development will
implement separate tables for each query dataset. This ensures high database
performance. With complex SQL queries, it will still be possible to connect
multiple datasets.

This practice also alleviates the pressure on the SHA-256 digests to be unique:
in a smaller object space, the probability of a hash collision decreases.
