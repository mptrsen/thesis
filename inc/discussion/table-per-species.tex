\label{sec:table-per-species}
At the time of this writing, the tables ``ests'', ``hmmsearch'' and ``blast''
are filled in a cumulative fashion, \ie, they contain data from all query
species. This affects performance because without administrative access to
server configuration and tuning variables, a too small InnoDB key buffer along
with very large tables becomes a performance bottleneck \citep{mysql2013}.
\pname is intended for users with no knowledge about MySQL administration, and
therefore fine-tuning of server variables in order to adapt to the amount of
data at hand is not possible. For this reason, future development will implement
separate tables for each query dataset, which will ensure an improved database
performance. With specialized SQL queries, it will still be possible to connect
multiple datasets.

This practice also alleviates the pressure on the SHA-256 digests to be unique:
in a smaller object space, the probability of a hash collision decreases.
