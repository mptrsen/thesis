\pname---a newly developed pipeline for gene orthology prediction in
transcriptome sequence data---was developed in the framework of this diploma
thesis. It follows a graph-based approach using hidden Markov models (HMMs) that
was implemented in its archetype software \hamstr. In the present thesis, the
concept of gene orthology was outlined and different strategies of orthology
assessment were compared. The pipeline algorithm was explained as well as
technical challenges and pitfalls highlighted. Different techniques have been
employed to overcome practical and theoretical obstacles. The result is a
modern, actively developed software pipeline that combines the power of HMMs
with state-of-the-art technology.
