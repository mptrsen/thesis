In \pname, the so-called soft threshold (\autoref{fig:soft-threshold}) was
introduced. Its concept is a compromise between a very strict search and a very
relaxed search. With a strict search criterion, an ortholog candidate would be
discarded if one of the reciprocal searches did not find a sequence that was
used in the HMM of the OG in question until all sequences of the OG have been
found. Under a relaxed search criterion, on the other hand, orthology is assumed
as soon as one of the OG sequences have been found. These settings are
appropriate in different conditions; however, with the soft threshold, a
compromise has been introduced. It allows very fine tuning of search
specificity.
