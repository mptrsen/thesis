In \hamstr, one BLAST database had to be maintained for each reference taxon.
This led to the problem of BLAST scores and e-values not being normalized: since
the reference proteome BLAST databases used in \hamstr are of differing sizes,
the e-values, which depend on the database size, cannot be compared across
reference taxa. To generate a ``normalized'' e-value, \hamstr takes an
additional comparison step using a pairwise alignment with ClustalW.

In contrast to \hamstr, \pname uses one BLAST database comprising all reference
taxa proteomes. E-values are comparable across taxa since the database is of
constant size. Additionally, only one BLAST search is required instead of $n$
searches, where $n$ is the number of reference taxa. This leads to a performance
boost of up to $n-1$ compared to \hamstr.
