The \pname algorithm is different from the one that is implemented in \hamstr:
Transcript sequences are not assigned to ortholog groups (OG) based on a per-OG
basis, but instead all possible graph edges are collected first and traversed by
ascending \tool{hmmsearch} e-value (see \autoref{fig:orthograph-graph}). This
has two advantages: firstly, it assures that the transcript sequences are mapped
to the most relevant OG, and not to the one that was processed first. Secondly,
by removing the transcript sequences from the list of candidate transcripts,
redundant assignment is precluded, \ie, the same transcript cannot be mapped to
multiple OGs or vice versa.
