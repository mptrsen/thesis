The results are of theoretical and practical nature and shed light on how a
pipeline for orthology prediction using HMMs and a RDBMS should be designed,
including challenges and pitfalls. 
The results also highlight the high potential of an extensive, metadata-enriched
ortholog cluster graph for phylogenetic and other analyses. 

During the development of \pname, I was faced with obstacles of both theoretical
and practical nature. I gained insights into the delicacies of modern Perl
development and high-performance MySQL database implementations.
