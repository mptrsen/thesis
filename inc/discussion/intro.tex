The results shed light on challenges and pitfalls in designing and implementing
a pipeline for orthology prediction using HMMs and an RDBMS. During development,
practical challenges, such as database performance, and theoretical
considerations, such as an additional threshold criterion, have been dealt with.
The findings highlight the high potential of an extensive, metadata-enriched
ortholog cluster graph for phylogenetic and other analyses.
