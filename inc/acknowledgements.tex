I thank Bernhard Misof for commiting this project to me, for helpful comments
and for maintaining such a great atmosphere in this working group.

Thanks to Oliver Niehuis for really good supervising and helpful discussions.
Your challenges made me outgrow my own boundaries.

I also thank Karen Meusemann for being a brilliant office-mate, for interesting
discussions, and for forming a great team. You made my diploma year.

Thanks to Alex Donath, Julia Schwarzer, Sandra Meid, Patrick Kück, Caro Greve,
Ralph Peters, Christoph Mayer, Jeanne Wilbrandt, Tanja Ziesmann, and Hannes
Jäkel for contributing to a good working group. Without all of you this year
wouldn't have been the same.

I also acknowledge Torsten Struck, who was the first to point out the redundant
assignment bug in \hamstr, and the helpful programming community at
\url{stackoverflow.com}, which helped me with tough questions concerning Perl
and MySQL, as well as Peter Grobe, whose concrete advice helped in designing the
database.

Thanks to Silvio Philipp as well as Alf and Monika Sibla for their friendship
and for taking my mind off everything else for a few hours each Wednesday. 

Many thanks to Hannah for making me smile every day, taking care of everything
and enduring my absent-mindedness the last few weeks. 

Finally, thanks to my parents. Without their continued support, I would not be
where I am today.
