I also acknowledge Torsten Struck, who was the first to point out the redundant
assignment bug in \hamstr, as well as the helpful programming community at
\url{stackoverflow.com}, which helped me with tough questions concerning Perl
and MySQL.

Thanks to Silvio Philipp as well as Alf and Monika Sibla for their friendship
and for taking my mind off everything else for a few hours each Wednesday. 

Many thanks to Hannah for making me smile, taking care of everything and
enduring my absent-mindedness the last few weeks.
